Today is a to do app with a focus on simplicity. Only the features you need to get things done.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do list apps are everywhere, but my biggest issue with them all is how bloated they all are. Social login, user tracking, email notifications. The list goes on. I wanted something really simple to get the job done, so I built it.

Aside from updating your account details, all you can do is create tasks or lists. Simple as that.
There is included a section with quotes for programs and from kanye's tweets.
